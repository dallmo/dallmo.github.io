- those handshake DNS are too unstable, giving them up, and went back to a static page with JAMstack ;
- using lume this time, both gatsby and fresh are too heavy ; 
- based on : https://lume.land/theme/simple-wiki/
- custom domain : wiki.dallmo.com

## updated as of 2025-05-31
- gitHub pages forÂ the github account dallmo
- temp parking index, handshake domain check, hosting on root, as of 2025-05-31-a.
  - handshake TLD : dallmo
  - domain for this page : info.dallmo

## updated as of 2024-01-04
- github pages for dallmo.com ; 
- built with gatsby, it loads fast when published, but kind of heavy when building / dev time, too much dependencies even for a minimal project ; 
- preferred the `Fresh` version deployed on deno.dev instead : https://dallmo.deno.dev ;
